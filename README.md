ActivitySim
===========
ActivitySim is a project to build an open platform for activity-based travel modeling.  It emerged from a consortium of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and other transportation planning agencies that wanted to build a shared, open, platform that could be easily adapted to their individual needs, but would share a robust, efficient, and well-maintained common core.

ActivitySim is being built on the same methodology and technology stack that UrbanSim is, and will initially have dependencies on UrbanSim, but these may eventually be eliminated by refactoring UrbanSim and creating a common core that both UrbanSim and ActivitySim depend on.
