    """
    Trip scheduling assigns depart times for trips within the start, end limits of the tour.

    The algorithm is simplistic:

    The first outbound trip starts at the tour start time, and subsequent outbound trips are
    processed in trip_num order, to ensure that subsequent trips do not depart before the
    trip that preceeds them.

    Inbound trips are handled similarly, except in reverse order, starting with the last trip,
    and working backwards to ensure that inbound trips do not depart after the trip that
    succeeds them.

    The probability spec assigns probabilities for depart times, but those possible departs must
    be clipped to disallow depart times outside the tour limits, the departs of prior trips, and
    in the case of work tours, the start/end times of any atwork subtours.

    Scheduling can fail if the probability table assigns zero probabilities to all the available
    depart times in a trip's depart window. (This could be avoided by giving every window a small
    probability, rather than zero, but the existing mtctm1 prob spec does not do this. I believe
    this is due to the its having been generated from a small household travel survey sample
    that lacked any departs for some time periods.)

    Rescheduling the trips that fail (along with their inbound or outbound leg-mates) can sometimes
    fix this problem, if it was caused by an earlier trip's depart choice blocking a subsequent
    trip's ability to schedule a depart within the resulting window. But it can also happen if
    a tour is very short (e.g. one time period) and the prob spec having a zero probability for
    that tour hour.

    Therefore we need to handle trips that could not be scheduled. There are two ways (at least)
    to solve this problem:

    1) choose_most_initial
    simply assign a depart time to the trip, even if it has a zero probability. It makes
    most sense, in this case, to assign the 'most initial' depart time, so that subsequent trips
    are minimally impacted. This can be done in the final iteration, thus affecting only the
    trips that could no be scheduled by the standard approach

    2) drop_and_cleanup
    drop trips that could no be scheduled, and adjust their leg mates, as is done for failed
    trips in trip_destination.

    Which option is applied is determined by the FAILFIX model setting
