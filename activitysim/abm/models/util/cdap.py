    Assign an integer index, cdap_rank, to each household member. (Starting with 1, not 0)

    Modifies persons df in place

    The cdap_rank order is important, because cdap only assigns activities to the first
    MAX_HHSIZE persons in each household.

    This will preferentially be two working adults and the three youngest children.

    Rank is assigned starting at 1. This necessitates some care indexing, but is preferred as
    it follows the convention of 1-based pnums in expression files.

    According to the documentation of reOrderPersonsForCdap in mtctm2.abm.ctramp
    HouseholdCoordinatedDailyActivityPatternModel:

    "Method reorders the persons in the household for use with the CDAP model,
    which only explicitly models the interaction of five persons in a HH. Priority
    in the reordering is first given to full time workers (up to two), then to
    part time workers (up to two workers, of any type), then to children (youngest
    to oldest, up to three). If the method is called for a household with less
    than 5 people, the cdapPersonArray is the same as the person array."

    We diverge from the above description in that a cdap_rank is assigned to all persons,
    including 'extra' householld members, whose activity is assigned subsequently.
    The pair _hh_id_, cdap_rank will uniquely identify each household member.
