# orca injectables complicate matters because the decorators are executed at module load time
# and since py.test collects modules and loads them at the start of a run
# if a test method does something that has a lasting side-effect, then that side effect
# will carry over not just to subsequent test functions, but to subsequently called modules
# for instance, columns added with add_column will remain attached to orca tables
# pytest-xdist allows us to run py.test with the --boxed option which runs every function
# with a brand new python interpreter

# Also note that the following import statement has the side-effect of registering injectables:
from .. import __init__
