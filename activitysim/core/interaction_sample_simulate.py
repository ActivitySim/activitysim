    Run a MNL simulation in the situation in which alternatives must
    be merged with choosers because there are interaction terms or
    because alternatives are being sampled.

    Parameters are same as for public function interaction_sample_simulate

    spec : dataframe
        one row per spec expression and one col with utility coefficient

    interaction_df : dataframe
        cross join (cartesian product) of choosers with alternatives
        combines columns of choosers and alternatives
        len(df) == len(choosers) * len(alternatives)
        index values (non-unique) are index values from alternatives df

    interaction_utilities : dataframe
        the utility of each alternative is sum of the partial utilities determined by the
        various spec expressions and their corresponding coefficients
        yielding a dataframe  with len(interaction_df) rows and one utility column
        having the same index as interaction_df (non-unique values from alternatives df)

    utilities : dataframe
        dot product of model_design.dot(spec)
        yields utility value for element in the cross product of choosers and alternatives
        this is then reshaped as a dataframe with one row per chooser and one column per alternative

    probs : dataframe
        utilities exponentiated and converted to probabilities
        same shape as utilities, one row per chooser and one column for alternative

    positions : series
        choices among alternatives with the chosen alternative represented
        as the integer index of the selected alternative column in probs

    choices : series
        series with the alternative chosen for each chooser
        the index is same as choosers
        and the series value is the alternative df index of chosen alternative

    Returns

            A series where index should match the index of the choosers DataFrame

    ----------

        DataFrame of choosers

        DataFrame of alternatives - will be merged with choosers
        index domain same as choosers, but repeated for each alternative
    spec : pandas.DataFrame
        A Pandas DataFrame that gives the specification of the variables to
        compute and the coefficients for each variable.
        Variable specifications must be in the table index and the
        table should have only one column of coefficients.
    skims : Skims object
        The skims object is used to contain multiple matrices of
        origin-destination impedances.  Make sure to also add it to the
        locals_d below in order to access it in expressions.  The *only* job
        of this method in regards to skims is to call set_df with the
        dataframe that comes back from interacting choosers with
        alternatives.  See the skims module for more documentation on how
        the skims object is intended to be used.
    locals_d : Dict
        This is a dictionary of local variables that will be the environment
        for an evaluation of an expression that begins with @
    chunk_size : int
        if chunk_size > 0 iterates over choosers in chunk_size chunks
    trace_label: str
        This is the label to be used  for trace log file entries and dump file names
        when household tracing enabled. No tracing occurs if label is empty or None.
