    Compute the utilities for a single-alternative spec evaluated in the context of df

    We could compute the utilities for interaction datasets just as we do for simple_simulate
    specs with multiple alternative columns by calling eval_variables and then computing the
    utilities by matrix-multiplication of eval results with the utility coefficients in the
    spec alternative columns.

    But interaction simulate computes the utilities of each alternative in the context of a
    separate row in interaction dataset df, and so there is only one alternative in spec.
    This turns out to be quite a bit faster (in this special case) than the pandas dot function.

    For efficiency, we combine eval_variables and multiplication of coefficients into a single step,
    so we don't have to create a separate column for each partial utility. Instead, we simply
    multiply the eval result by a single alternative coefficient and sum the partial utilities.


    spec : dataframe

    df : dataframe

        combines columns of choosers and alternatives
        len(df) == len(choosers) * len(alternatives)
        index values (non-unique) are index values from alternatives df

    interaction_utilities : dataframe
        the utility of each alternative is sum of the partial utilities determined by the
        various spec expressions and their corresponding coefficients
        yielding a dataframe  with len(interaction_df) rows and one utility column
        having the same index as interaction_df (non-unique values from alternatives df)

    Returns
    -------
    utilities : pandas.DataFrame
