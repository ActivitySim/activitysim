# input tables
#
# activitysim uses "well-known" index and foreign key names for imported tables (e.g. households, persons, land_use)
# as well as for created tables (tours, joint_tour_participants, trips)
# e.g. the households table must have an index column 'household_id' and the foreign key to households in the
# persons table is also household_id. This naming convention allows activitysim to intuit the relationship
# between tables - for instance, to ensure that multiprocess slicing includes all the persons, tours, and trips
# in the same subprocess pipeline. The same strategy is also when chunking choosers, and to support tracing by
# household_id.
#
# the input_table_list index_col directive instructs activitysim to set the imported table index to zone_id
# you cannot change the well-known name of the index by modifying this directive. However, if your input file
# has a different id column name, you can rename it to the required index name with the rename_columns directive.
# In the settings below, the 'TAZ' column in the imported table is renamed 'zone_id' in the rename_columns settings.
