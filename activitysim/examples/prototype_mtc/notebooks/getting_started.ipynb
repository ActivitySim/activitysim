This also installs dependent packages such as [tables](https://pypi.org/project/tables/) for reading/writing HDF5, [openmatrix](https://pypi.org/project/OpenMatrix/) for reading/writing OMX matrix, and [pyyaml](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) for yaml settings files.  The command below also creates an asim [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) just for activitysim."

    "\n",
    "The command below runs the multiprocessor example, which runs in a few minutes.  It uses settings inheritance to override setings in the configs folder with settings in the configs_mp folder.  This allows for re-using expression files and settings files in the single and multiprocessed setups.  The multiprocessed example uses the following additional settings:\n",

    "In brief, `num_processes` specifies the number of processors to use and a `chunk_size` of `0` plus a `chunk_training_mode` of `disabled` means ActivitySim is free to use all the available RAM if needed.  The `multiprocess_steps` specifies the beginning, middle, and end steps in multiprocessing.  The `mp_initialize` step is single processed because there is no `slice` setting.  It starts with the `initialize_landuse` submodel and runs until the submodel identified by the next multiprocess submodel starting point, `school_location`.  The `mp_households` step is multiprocessed and the households and persons tables are sliced and allocated to processes using the chunking settings.  The rest of the submodels are run multiprocessed until the final multiprocess step.  The `mp_summarize` step is single processed because there is no `slice` setting and it writes outputs.  See [multiprocessing](https://activitysim.github.io/activitysim/core.html#multiprocessing) and [chunk_size](https://activitysim.github.io/activitysim/core.html#chunk) for more information.  "
