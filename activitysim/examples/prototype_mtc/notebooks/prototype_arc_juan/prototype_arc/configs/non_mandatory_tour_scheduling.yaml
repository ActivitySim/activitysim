sharrow_skip: true
# The `sharrow_skip` option is activated to disable the use of sharrow for this
# model, because the utility specification as currently written includes a
# large number of string comparisons (nearly every one of 300+ expressions has
# such an operation). Sharrow can process these expressions correctly, but it is
# slow.  If the specification is rewritten to remove most of these string
# comparisons (see for example in the equivalent file for the prototype_mtc
# models) then sharrow can be re-enabled for a significant speed benefit.
