#
#  mtc_full
#
#   This workflow runs the Prototype MTC model using full skims (1454 zones),
#   in a single process runner.  It is well suited for conducting timing and
#   memory usage studies, as well as smaller model quality and validation
#   studies. For running the full population, consider running in multiprocess
#   mode with the `mtc_mp` workflow.
