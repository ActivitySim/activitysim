<h1>Software Development<a class="headerlink" href="#software-development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This page documents the ActivitySim software design and how to contribute to the project.</p>
<div class="section" id="software-design">
<h2>Software Design<a class="headerlink" href="#software-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The core software components of ActivitySim are described below.  ActivitySim is
implemented in Python, and makes heavy use of the vectorized backend C/C++ libraries in
<a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a>  and <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.org">numpy</a> in order to be quite performant.
The core design principle of the system is vectorization of for loops, and this principle
is woven into the system wherever reasonable.  As a result, the Python portions of the software
can be thought of as more of an orchestrator, data processor, etc. that integrates a series of
C/C++ vectorized data table and matrix operations.  The model system formulates
each simulation as a series of vectorized table operations and the Python layer
is responsible for setting up and providing expressions to operate on these large data tables.</p>
<p>In developing this software platform, we strive to adhere to a best practices approach to scientific computing,
as summarized in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745">this article.</a></p>
<div class="section" id="model-orchestrator">
<h3>Model Orchestrator<a class="headerlink" href="#model-orchestrator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An ActivitySim model is a sequence of model / data processing steps, commonly known as a data pipeline.
A well defined data pipeline has the ability to resume jobs at a known point, which facilitates
debugging of problems with data and/or calculations.  It also allows for checkpointing model
resources, such as the state of each person at a point in the model simulation.  Checkpointing also
allows for regression testing of results at specified points in overall model run.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of ActivitySim depended on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/udst/orca">ORCA</a>, an orchestration/pipeline tool
that defines model steps, dynamic data sources, and connects them to processing functions. ORCA defined dynamic data tables
based on pandas DataFrames, columns based on pandas Series, and injectables (functions).  Model steps
were executed as steps registered with the ORCA engine.  Over time ActivitySim has extended ORCA’s functionality by
adding a <a class="reference internal" href="core.html#pipeline-in-detail"><span class="std std-ref">Pipeline</span></a> that runs a series of model steps, manages the state of the data
tables throughout the model run, allows for restarting at any model step, and integrates with the
random number generation procedures (see <a class="reference internal" href="core.html#random-in-detail"><span class="std std-ref">Random</span></a>).  As a result, ORCA is no longer a dependency of
the system.  See <a class="reference internal" href="core.html#module-activitysim.core.inject" title="activitysim.core.inject"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">activitysim.core.inject</span></code></a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-handling">
<h3>Data Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#data-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ActivitySim works with three open data formats, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a>
, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/osPlanning/omx">Open Matrix (OMX)</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> .
The HDF5 binary data container is used for the <a class="reference internal" href="core.html#pipeline-in-detail"><span class="std std-ref">Pipeline</span></a> data store.
OMX, which is based on HDF5, is used for input and output matrices (skims and demand matrices).  CSV files
are used for various inputs and outputs as well.</p>
<p>Three key data structures in ActivitySim are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html">pandas.DataFrame</a> - A data table with rows and columns, similar to an R data frame, Excel worksheet, or database table</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html">pandas.Series</a> - a vector of data, a column in a DataFrame table or a 1D array</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.html">numpy.array</a> - an N-dimensional array of items of the same type, and is often a network skim matrix or collection of skim matrices by time-period or mode for example</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expressions">
<h3>Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#expressions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ActivitySim exposes all model expressions in CSV files.  These model expression CSV files
contain Python expressions, mainly pandas/numpy expression, and reference input data tables
and network skim matrices.  With this design, the Python code, which can be thought of as a generic expression
engine, and the specific model calculations, such as the utilities, are separate.  This helps to avoid
modifying the actual Python code when making changes to the models, such as during model calibration. An
example of model expressions is found in the example auto ownership model specification file -
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim/blob/master/example/configs/auto_ownership.csv">auto_ownership.csv</a>.
Refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="core.html#expressions"><span class="std std-ref">Utility Expressions</span></a> section for more detail.</p>
<p>Many of the models have pre- and post-processor table annotators, which read a CSV file of expression, calculate
required additional table fields, and join the fields to the target tables.  An example table annotation expressions
file is found in the example configuration files for households for the CDAP model -
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim/blob/master/example/configs/annotate_households_cdap.csv">annotate_households_cdap.csv</a>.
Refer to <a class="reference internal" href="models.html#table-annotation"><span class="std std-ref">Estimation</span></a> for more information and the <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">activitysim.abm.models.util.expressions.assign_columns()</span></code> function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choice-models">
<h3>Choice Models<a class="headerlink" href="#choice-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ActivitySim currently supports multinomial (MNL) and nested logit (NL) choice models. Refer to <a class="reference internal" href="core.html#logit-in-detail"><span class="std std-ref">Logit</span></a>
for more information.  It also supports custom expressions as noted above, which can often be used to
code additional types of choice models.  In addition, developers can write their own choice models
in Python and expose these through the framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="person-time-windows">
<h3>Person Time Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#person-time-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The departure time and duration models require person time windows. Time windows are adjacent time
periods that are available for travel. ActivitySim maintains time windows in a pandas table where each row is
a person and each time period is a column.  As travel is scheduled throughout the simulation, the relevant
columns for the tour, trip, etc. are updated as needed. Refer to <a class="reference internal" href="core.html#time-windows"><span class="std std-ref">Person Time Windows</span></a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="models">
<h3>Models<a class="headerlink" href="#models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An activitysim travel model is made up of a series of models, or steps in the data pipeline.  A model
typically does the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>registers an ORCA step that is called by the model runner</p></li>
<li><p>sets up logging and tracing</p></li>
<li><p>gets the relevant input data tables from ORCA</p></li>
<li><p>gets all required settings, config files, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>runs a data preprocessor on each input table that needs additional fields for the calculation</p></li>
<li><p>solves the model in chunks of data table rows</p></li>
<li><p>runs a data postprocessor on the output table data that needs additional fields for later models</p></li>
<li><p>writes the resulting table data to the pipeline</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="models.html#models"><span class="std std-ref">Models</span></a> for more information.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="development-install">
<h2>Development Install<a class="headerlink" href="#development-install" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The development version of ActivitySim can be installed as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Clone or fork the source from the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim">GitHub repository</a></p></li>
<li><p>Activate the correct conda environment if needed</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to your local activitysim git directory</p></li>
<li><p>Run the command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">develop</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">develop</span></code> command is required in order to make changes to the

<h3>Working Together in the Repository<a class="headerlink" href="#working-together-in-the-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We use <a class="reference external" href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow">GitHub Flow</a>.  The key points to
our GitHub workflow are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The master branch contains the latest working/release version of the ActivitySim resources</p></li>
<li><p>The master branch is protected and therefore can only be written to by the <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> CI system</p></li>
<li><p>Work is done in an issue/feature branch (or a fork) and then pushed to a new branch</p></li>
<li><p>The test system automatically runs the tests on the new branch</p></li>
<li><p>If the tests pass, then a manual pull request can be approved to merge into master</p></li>
<li><p>The repository administrator handles the pull request and makes sure that related resources such as the wiki, documentation, issues, etc. are updated.  See <a class="reference internal" href="#release-steps"><span class="std std-ref">Releases</span></a> for more information.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="versioning">
<h3>Versioning<a class="headerlink" href="#versioning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ActivitySim uses the following <a class="reference external" href="http://the-hitchhikers-guide-to-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html">versioning convention</a></p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">MAJOR</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MINOR</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>where MAJOR designates a major revision number for the software, like 2 or 3 for Python. Usually, raising a major revision number means that you are adding a lot of features, breaking backward-compatibility or drastically changing the APIs (Application Program Interface) or ABIs (Application Binary Interface).</p></li>
<li><p>MINOR usually groups moderate changes to the software like bug fixes or minor improvements. Most of the time, end users can upgrade with no risks their software to a new minor release. In case an API changes, the end users will be notified with deprecation warnings. In other words, API and ABI stability is usually a promise between two minor releases.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h3>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ActivitySim testing is done with three tools:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycodestyle">pycodestyle</a>, a tool to check Python code against the pycodestyle style conventions</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://pytest.org/latest/">pytest</a>, a Python testing tool</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coagulant/coveralls-python">coveralls</a>, a tool for measuring code coverage and publishing code coverage stats online</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To run the tests locally, first make sure the required packages are installed:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pip</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">pytest</span> <span class="n">pytest</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">cov</span> <span class="n">coveralls</span> <span class="n">pycodestyle</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next, run the tests with the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pycodestyle</span> <span class="n">activitysim</span>
<span class="n">py</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">cov</span> <span class="n">activitysim</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">cov</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">report</span> <span class="n">term</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">missing</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These same tests are run by Travis with each push to the repository.  These tests need to pass in order
to merge the revisions into master.</p>
<p>In some cases, test targets need to be updated to match the new results produced by the code since these
are now the correct results.  In order to update the test targets, first determine which tests are
failing and then review the failing lines in the source files.  These are easy to identify since each
test ultimately comes down to one of Python’s various types of <cite>assert</cite> statements.  Once you identify
which <cite>assert</cite> is failing, you can work your way back through the code that creates the test targets in
order to update it.  After updating the test targets, re-run the tests to confirm the new code passes all
the tests.</p>

<div class="section" id="profiling">
<h3>Profiling<a class="headerlink" href="#profiling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A handy way to profile ActivitySim model runs is to use <a class="reference external" href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/">snakeviz</a>.
To do so, first install snakeviz and then run ActivitySim with the Python profiler (cProfile) to create
a profiler file.  Then run snakeviz on the profiler file to interactively explore the component runtimes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h3>Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The documentation is written in <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> markup
and built with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/">Sphinx</a>.  In addition to converting rst files
to html and other document formats, these tools also read the inline Python docstrings and convert
them into html as well.  ActivitySim’s docstrings are written in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt">numpydoc format</a> since it is easier to use
than standard rst format.</p>
<p>To build the documentation, first make sure the required packages are installed:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next, build the documentation in html format with the following command run from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docs</span></code> folder:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">html</span>

<p>If the activitysim package is installed, then the documentation will be built from that version of
the source code instead of the git repo version.  Make sure to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">uninstall</span> <span class="pre">activitysim</span></code> before
building the documentation if needed.</p>
<p>When pushing revisions to the repo, the documentation is automatically built by Travis after
successfully passing the tests.  The documents are built with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bin/build_docs.sh</span></code> script.
The script does the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>installs the required python packages</p></li>
<li><p>runs <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">html</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>copies the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">../activitysim/docs/_build/html/*</span></code> pages to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gh-pages</span></code> branch</p></li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub automatically publishes the gh-pages branch at <a class="reference external" href="https://activitysim.github.io/activitysim">https://activitysim.github.io/activitysim</a>.</p>

<p>ActivitySim includes several mature or in-development full scale agency <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#examples"><span class="std std-ref">Examples</span></a>.  Adding an agency example to ActivitySim adds additional assurances that future updates to ActivitySim will more easily work for users.  At the same time, with each additional implementation, the need for additional test coverage increases.  This increased need for test coverage relates to when setting up a new model, with differences in inputs and configurations, when adding new model components (and/or revisions to the core) in order to implement new features, and when implementing model components at a scale previously untested.  The following section describes the process to add an agency example model to ActivitySim.</p>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h3>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, there are two types of ActivitySim examples: test examples and agency examples.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Test examples - these are the core ActivitySim maintained and tested examples developed to date.  The current test examples are <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-mtc"><span class="std std-ref">example_mtc</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-estimation"><span class="std std-ref">example_estimation</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-multiple-zones"><span class="std std-ref">example_multiple_zones</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-marin"><span class="std std-ref">example_marin</span></a>.  These examples are owned and maintained by the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Agency examples - these are agency partner model implementations currently being setup.  The current agency examples are <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-arc"><span class="std std-ref">example_arc</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-semcog"><span class="std std-ref">example_semcog</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-psrc"><span class="std std-ref">example_psrc</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-sandag"><span class="std std-ref">example_sandag</span></a>.  These examples can be configured in ways different from the test examples, include new inputs and expressions, and may include new planned software components for contribution to ActivitySim.  These examples are owned by the agency.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, multiple versions of these examples can exist, and be used for various testing purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Full scale - a full scale data setup, including all households, zones, skims, time periods, etc.  This is a “typical” model setup used for application.  This setup can be used to test the model results and performance since model results can be compared to observed/known answers and runtimes can be compared to industry experience.  It can also be used to test core software functionality such as tracing and repeatability.</p></li>
<li><p>Cropped - a subset of households and zones for efficient / portable running for testing.  This setup can really only be used to test the software since model results are difficult to compare to observed/known answers.  This version of an example is not recommended for testing overall runtime since it’s a convenience sample and may not represent the true regional model travel demand patterns.  However, depending on the question, this setup may be able to answer questions related to runtime, such as improvements to methods indifferent to the size of the population and number of zones.</p></li>
<li><p>Other - a specific route/path through the code for testing.  For example, the estimation example tests the estimation mode functionality.  The estimation example is a version of the example mtc example - it inherits most settings from example mtc and includes additional settings for reading in survey files and producing estimation data bundles.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h3>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The test plan for test examples versus agency examples is different:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Test examples test software features such as stability, tracing, expression solving, etc.  This set of tests is run by the TravisCI system and is a central feature of the software development process.</p></li>
<li><p>Agency examples test a complete run of the cropped version to ensure it runs and the results are as expected.  This is done via a simple run model test that runs the cropped version and compares the output trip list to the expected trip list.  This is what is known as a regression test.  This test is also run by TravisCI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of examples are stored in the ActivitySim repositories for version control and collaborative maintenance.  There are two storage locations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim/tree/master/activitysim/examples">activitysim package example folder</a>, which stores the test and agency example setup files, cropped data and cropping script, regression test script, expected results, and a change log to track any revisions to the example to get it working for testing.  These resources are the resources automatically tested by the TravisCI test system with each revision to the software.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim_resources">activitysim_resources repository</a>, which stores just the full scale example data inputs using <a class="reference external" href="https://git-lfs.github.com">Git LFS</a>.  This repository has a monthly cost and takes time to upload/download and so the contents of it are separate from the main software repository.  These resources are the resources periodically and manually tested (for now).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This two-part solution allows for the main activitysim repo to remain relatively lightweight, while providing an organized and accessible storage solution for the full scale example data.  The ActivitySim command line interface for creating and running examples makes uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim/blob/master/activitysim/examples/example_manifest.yaml">example_manifest.yaml</a> to maintain the dictionary of the examples and how to get and run them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-the-test-system">
<h3>Running the Test System<a class="headerlink" href="#running-the-test-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The automatic TravisCI test system runs the test examples and the cropped agency examples.  Examples of the testing
resources for each agency example that need to be up-to-date are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim/tree/master/activitysim/examples/example_semcog/scripts">scripts folder (including crop script)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim/tree/master/activitysim/examples/example_semcog/test">test folder (including test script)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim/tree/master/activitysim/examples/example_semcog/test/regress">regress folder (including expected outputs)</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the time being, running the full scale examples is done manually since it involves getting and running several large examples that take many hours to run.  The entire system could be fully automated, and either run in the cloud or on a local server.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="update-use-cases">
<h3>Update Use Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#update-use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To better illustrate the workflow for adding agency examples, a series of use cases is discussed.</p>
<p>When a new version of the code is pushed to develop:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The automatic test system is run to ensure the tests associated with the test examples pass.  If any of the tests do not pass, then either the code or the expected test results are updated until the tests pass.</p></li>
<li><p>The automatic test system also runs each cropped agency example regression test to ensure the model runs and produces the same results as before.  If any of the tests do not pass, then either the code or the expected test results are updated until the tests pass.  However, the process for resolving issues with agency example test failure has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the agency example previous ran without error or future warnings (i.e. deprecation warnings and is therefore up-to-date), then the developer will be responsible for updating the agency example so it passes the tests</p></li>
<li><p>If the agency example previously threw errors or future warnings (i.e. is not up-to-date), then the developer will not update the example and the responsibility will fall to the agency to update it when they have time.  This will not preclude development from advancing since the agency specific test can fail while the other tests continue to pass.  If the agency example is not updated within an agreed upon time frame, then the example is removed from the test system.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To help understand this case, the addition of support for representative logsums to <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-mtc"><span class="std std-ref">example_mtc</span></a> is discussed.  Example_mtc was selected as the test case for development of this feature because this feature could be implemented and tested against this example, which is the primary example to date.  With the new feature configured for this example, the automatic test system was run to ensure all the existing test examples pass their tests.  The automatic test system was also run to ensure all the cropped agency examples passed their tests, but since not of them include this new feature in their configuration, the test results were the same and therefore the tests passed.</p>
<p>When an agency wants to update their example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is recommended that agencies keep their examples up-to-date to minimize the cost/effort of updating to new versions of ActivitySim.  However, the frequency with which to make that update is a key issue.  The recommended frequency of ensuring the agency example is up-to-date depends on the ActivitySim development roadmap/phasing and the current features being developed.  Based on past project experience, it probably makes sense to not let agency examples fall more than a few months behind schedule, or else updates can get onerous.</p></li>
<li><p>When making an agency model update, agencies update their example through a pull request.  This pull request changes nothing outside their example folder.  The updated resources may include updated configs, inputs, revisions to the cropped data/cropping script, and expected test results.  The automatic cropped example test must run without warnings.  The results of the full scale version is shared with the development team in the PR comments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To help understand this case, the inclusion of <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-psrc"><span class="std std-ref">example_psrc</span></a> as an agency example is discussed.  Example_psrc is PSRC’s experimentation of a two zone model and is useful for testing the two zone features, including runtime.  A snapshot of PSRC’s efforts to setup an ActivitySim model with PSRC inputs was added to the test system as a new agency example, called example_psrc.  After some back and forth between the development team and PSRC, a full scale version of example_psrc was successfully run.  The revisions required to create a cropped version and full scale version were saved in a change log included with the example.  When PSRC wants to update example_psrc, PSRC will pull the latest develop code branch and then update example_psrc so the cropped and full scale example both run without errors.  PSRC also needs to update the expected test results.  Once everything is in good working order, then PSRC issues a pull request to develop to pull their updated example.  Once pulled, the automatic test system will run the cropped version of example_psrc.</p>
<p>When an agency example includes new submodels and/or contributions to the core that need to be reviewed and then pulled/accepted:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>First, the agency example must comply with the steps outlined above under “When an agency wants to update their example”.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, the agency example must be up-to-date with the latest develop version of the code so the revisions to the code are only the exact revisions for the new submodels and/or contributions to the core.</p></li>
<li><p>The new submodels and/or contributions to the core will then be reviewed by the repository manager and it’s likely some revisions will be required for acceptance.  Key items in the review include python code, user documentation, and testable examples for all new components.  If the contribution is just new submodels, then the agency example that exercises the new submodel is sufficient for test coverage since TravisCI will automatically test the cropped version of the new submodel.  If the contribution includes revisions to the core that impact other test examples, then the developer is responsible for ensuring all the other tests that are up-to-date are updated/passing as well.  This includes other agency examples that are up-to-date.  This is required to ensure the contribution to the core is adequately complete.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To help understand this case, the addition of the parking location choice model for <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#example-arc"><span class="std std-ref">example_arc</span></a> is discussed.  First, ARC gets their example in good working order - i.e. updates to develop, makes any required revisions to their model to get it working, creates a cropped and full scaled example, and creates the expected test results.  In addition, this use case includes additional submodel and/or core code so ARC also authors the new feature, including documentation and any other relevant requirements such as logging, tracing, support for estimation, etc.  With the new example and feature working offline, then ARC issues a pull request to add example_arc and the new submodel/core code and makes sure the automatic tests are passing.  Once accepted, the automatic test system will run the test example tests and the cropped agency examples.  Since the new feature - parking location choice model - is included in example_arc, then new feature is now tested.  Any testing of downstream impacts from the parking location choice model would also need to be implemented in the example.</p>
