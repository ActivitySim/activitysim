Example
=======

This page describes the example model design, how to setup and run the example, how to review outputs, and 
how to re-estimate submodels. The default configuration of the example is limited to a small sample of 
households and zones so that it can be run quickly and require less than 1 GB of RAM.  The full scale example 
can be configured and run as well.

Example Model Design
--------------------

The example AB model implemented with the activitysim framework is
`Bay Area Metro Travel Model One <https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/travel-model-one>`__ (TM1).
TM1 has its roots in a wide array of analytical approaches, including discrete
choice forms (multinomial and nested logit models), activity duration models, time-use models,
models of individual micro-simulation with constraints, entropy-maximization models, etc.
These tools are combined in the model design to realistically represent travel behavior,
adequately replicate observed activity-travel patterns, and ensure model sensitivity to
infrastructure and policies. The model is implemented in a micro-simulation framework. Microsimulation
methods capture aggregate outcomes through the representation of the behavior of
individual decision-makers.

Space
~~~~~

TM1 uses the 1454 TAZ zone system developed for the MTC trip-based model.  The zones are fairly large for the region,
which may somewhat distort the representation of transit access in mode choice. To ameliorate this problem, the
original model zones were further sub-divided into three categories of transit access: short walk, long walk, and not
walkable.  However, support for transit subzones is not included in the activitysim implementation since the latest generation
of activity-based models typically use an improved approach to spatial representation called multiple zone systems.

In a multiple zone system approach, households, land use, and trips are modeled at the microzone (MAZ) level.  MAZs are smaller 
than traditional TAZs and therefore make for a more precise system.  However, when considering network level-of-service (LOS) 
indicators (e.g. skims), the model uses different spatial resolutions for different travel modes in order to reduce the network 
modeling burden.  The typical multiple zone system setup is a TAZ zone system for auto travel, a MAZ zone system for 
non-motorized travel, and optionally a transit access points (TAPs) zone system for transit.  See :ref:`multiple_zone_systems` for 
more information.

Decision-making units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decision-makers in the model system are households and persons. These decision-makers are
created for each simulation year based on a population synthesis process such as
`PopulationSim <https://github.com/ActivitySim/PopulationSim>`__. The decision-makers are used in the
subsequent discrete-choice models to select a single alternative from a list of available
alternatives according to a probability distribution. The probability distribution is generated
from various logit-form models which take into account the attributes of the decision-maker and
the attributes of the various alternatives. The decision-making unit is an important element of
model estimation and implementation, and is explicitly identified for each model.

Person type segmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TM1 is implemented in a micro-simulation framework. A key advantage of the
micro-simulation approach is that there are essentially no computational constraints on the
number of explanatory variables which can be included in a model specification. However, even
with this flexibility, the model system includes some segmentation of decision-makers.
Segmentation is a useful tool both to structure models and also as a way to characterize person
roles within a household.

The person types shown below are used for the example model. The person types are mutually exclusive
with respect to age, work status, and school status.

+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------+---------------+
| Person Type                                               | Age     | Work Status      | School Status |
+===========================================================+=========+==================+===============+
| Full-time worker (30+ hours a week)                       | 18+     | Full-time        | None          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------+---------------+
| Part-time worker (<30 hours but works on a regular basis) | 18+     | Part-time        | None          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------+---------------+
| Non-working adult                                         | 18 - 64 | Unemployed       | None          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------+---------------+
| Retired person                                            | 65+     | Unemployed       | None          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------+---------------+
| College student                                           | 18+     | Any              | College       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------+---------------+
| Driving age student                                       | 16 - 17 | Any              | Pre-college   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------+---------------+
| Non-driving student                                       | 6 - 16  | None             | Pre-college   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------+---------------+
| Pre-school child                                          | 0 - 5   | None             | Preschool     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------+---------------+

Household type segments are useful for pre-defining certain data items (such as destination
choice size terms) so that these data items can be pre-calculated for each segment. Precalculation
of these data items reduces model complexity and runtime. The segmentation is based on household income,
and includes four segments - low, medium, high, very high.

In the model, the persons in each household are assigned a simulated but fixed value of time
that modulates the relative weight the decision-maker places on time and cost. The probability
distribution from which the value of time is sampled was derived from a toll choice model
estimated using data from a stated preference survey performed for the SFCTA Mobility, Access, and
Pricing Study, and is a lognormal distribution with a mean that varies by income segment.

Activity type segmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The activity types are used in most model system components, from developing daily activity patterns
and to predicting tour and trip destinations and modes by purpose.  The set of activity types is shown below.
The activity types are also grouped according to whether the activity is mandatory or non-mandatory and
eligibility requirements are assigned determining which person-types can be used for generating each
activity type. The classification scheme of each activity type reflects the relative importance or
natural hierarchy of the activity, where work and school activities are typically the most inflexible
in terms of generation, scheduling and location, and discretionary activities are typically the most
flexible on each of these dimensions. Each out-of-home location that a person travels to in the
simulation is assigned one of these activity types.

Treatment of time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TM1 example model system functions at a temporal resolution of one hour. These one hour increments
begin with 3 AM and end with 3 AM the next day. Temporal integrity is ensured so that no
activities are scheduled with conflicting time windows, with the exception of short
activities/tours that are completed within a one hour increment. For example, a person may have
a short tour that begins and ends within the 8 AM to 9 AM period, as well as a second longer tour
that begins within this time period, but ends later in the day.

A critical aspect of the model system is the relationship between the temporal resolution used for
scheduling activities and the temporal resolution of the network assignment periods. Although
each activity generated by the model system is identified with a start time and end time in one hour
increments, LOS matrices are only created for five aggregate time periods. The trips occurring in each time period
reference the appropriate transport network depending on their trip mode and the mid-point trip
time. The definition of time periods for LOS matrices is given below.

+---------------+------------+
|  Time Period  | Start Hour |
+===============+============+
|  EA           |  3         |
+---------------+------------+
|  AM           |  5         |
+---------------+------------+
|  MD           |  9         |
+---------------+------------+
|  PM           |  14        |
+---------------+------------+
|  EV           |  18        |
+---------------+------------+

Trip modes

The trip modes defined in the example model are below. The modes include auto by
occupancy and toll/non-toll choice, walk and bike, walk and drive access to five different
transit line-haul modes, and ride hail with taxi, single TNC (Transportation Network Company), and shared TNC.

      * Drive to Heavy Rail
  
  * Ride Hail
  
    * Taxi
    * Single TNC
    * Shared TNC

Sub-models
~~~~~~~~~~

The general design of the example model is presented below.  Long-term choices that relate to
the usual workplace/university/school for each worker and student, household car ownership, and the
availability of free parking at workplaces are first.

The coordinated daily activity pattern type of each household member is the first travel-related
sub-model in the hierarchy. This model classifies daily patterns by three types:

  * Mandatory, which includes at least one out-of-home mandatory activity (work or school)
  * Non-mandatory, which includes at least one out-of-home non-mandatory activity, but does not include out-of-home mandatory activities
  * Home, which does not include any out-of-home activity or travel

The pattern type sub-model leaves open the frequency of tours for mandatory and nonmandatory
purposes since these sub-models are applied later in the model sequence. Daily
pattern-type choices of the household members are linked in such a way that decisions made by
members are reflected in the decisions made by the other members.

After the frequency and time-of-day for work and school tours are determined, the
next major model component relates to joint household travel. This component produces a
number of joint tours by travel purpose for the entire household, travel party composition
in terms of adults and children, and then defines the participation of each household
member in each joint household tour. It is followed by choice of destination and time-ofday.

The next stage relates to maintenance and discretionary tours that are modeled at the individual
person level. The models include tour frequency, choice of destination and time
of day. Next, a set of sub-models relate tour-level details on mode, exact number of
intermediate stops on each half-tour and stop location. It is followed by the last set of
sub-models that add details for each trip including trip departure time, trip mode details and parking
location for auto trips.

The output of the model is a disggregate table of trips with individual attributes for custom analysis.  The trips
can be aggregated into travel demand matrices for network loading.

Setup
-----

The following describes the example model setup.


Folder and File Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example has the following root folder/file setup:

  * configs - settings, expressions files, etc.
  * configs_mp - override settings for the multiprocess configuration
  * data - input data such as land use, synthetic population files, and network LOS / skims
  * output - outputs folder

Inputs
~~~~~~

In order to run the example, you first need the input files in the ``data`` folder as identified in the ``configs\settings.yaml`` file and the ``configs\network_los.yaml`` file:

* input_table_list: the input CSV tables from MTC travel model one:

    * households - Synthetic population household records for a subset of zones.
    * persons - Synthetic population person records for a subset of zones.
    * land_use - Zone-based land use data (population and employment for example) for a subset of zones.

* taz_skims: skims.omx - an OMX matrix file containing the MTC travel model one skim matrices for a subset of zones.  The time period for the matrix must be represented at the end of the matrix name and be seperated by a double_underscore (e.g. BUS_IVT__AM indicates base skim BUS_IVT with a time period of AM.

These files are used in the tests as well and are in the ``activitysim\abm\test\data`` folder.  The full set
of MTC TM1 households, persons, and OMX skims are on the ActivitySim `resources repository <https://github.com/rsginc/activitysim_resources>`__.

.. note::
  
  ActivitySim can optionally build an HDF5 file of the input CSV tables for use in subsequent runs since
  HDF5 is binary and therefore results in faster read times. see :ref:`configuration`

  OMX and HDF5 files can be viewed with the `OMX Viewer <https://github.com/osPlanning/omx/wiki/OMX-Viewer>`__ or 
  `HDFView <https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview>`__.
  
  The ``other_resources\scripts\build_omx.py`` script will build one OMX file containing all the skims. The original MTC TM1 skims were converted from
  Cube to OMX using the ``other_resources\scripts\mtc_tm1_omx_export.s`` script.

  The example inputs were created by the ``other_resources\scripts\create_sf_example.py`` script, which creates the land use, synthetic population, and 
  skim inputs for a subset of user-defined zones.

.. _configuration:

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``configs`` folder contains settings, expressions files, and other files required for specifying
model utilities and form.  The first place to start in the ``configs`` folder is ``settings.yaml``, which
is the main settings file for the model run.  This file includes:

* ``models`` - list of model steps to run - auto ownership, tour frequency, etc. - see :ref:`model_steps`
* ``resume_after`` - to resume running the data pipeline after the last successful checkpoint
* ``input_store`` - HDF5 inputs file
* ``input_table_list`` - list of table names, indices, and column re-maps for each table in `input_store`

    * ``tablename`` - name of the injected table
    * ``filename`` - name of the CSV or HDF5 file to read (optional, defaults to `input_store`)
    * ``index_col`` - table column to use for the index
    * ``rename_columns`` - dictionary of column name mappings
    * ``keep_columns`` - columns to keep once read in to memory to save on memory needs and file I/O
    * ``h5_tablename`` - table name if reading from HDF5 and different from `tablename`

* ``create_input_store`` - write new 'input_data.h5' file to outputs folder using CSVs from `input_table_list` to use for subsequent model runs
* ``households_sample_size`` - number of households to sample and simulate; comment out to simulate all households
* ``trace_hh_id`` - trace household id; comment out for no trace
* ``trace_od`` - trace origin, destination pair in accessibility calculation; comment out for no trace
* ``chunk_size`` - batch size for processing choosers and should be set to 1 for dynamic chunking, see :ref:`chunk_size`
* ``check_for_variability`` - disable check for variability in an expression result debugging feature in order to speed-up runtime
* ``use_shadow_pricing`` - turn shadow_pricing on and off for work and school location
* ``output_tables`` - list of output tables to write to CSV or HDF5
* ``want_dest_choice_sample_tables`` - turn writing of sample_tables on and off for all models
* global variables that can be used in expressions tables and Python code such as:

    * ``urban_threshold`` - urban threshold area type max value
    * ``county_map`` - mapping of county codes to county names
    * ``household_median_value_of_time`` - various household and person value-of-time model settings

Also in the ``configs`` folder is ``network_los.yaml``, which includes network LOS / skims settings such as:

* ``zone_system`` - 1 (taz), 2 (maz and taz), or 3 (maz, taz, tap)
* ``taz_skims`` - skim matrices in one OMX file.  The time period for the matrix must be represented at the end of the matrix name and be seperated by a double_underscore (e.g. BUS_IVT__AM indicates base skim BUS_IVT with a time period of AM.
* ``skim_time_periods`` - time period upper bound values and labels

    * ``time_window`` - total duration (in minutes) of the modeled time span (Default: 1440 minutes (24 hours))
    * ``period_minutes`` - length of time (in minutes) each model time period represents. Must be whole factor of ``time_window``. (Default: 60 minutes)
    * ``periods`` - Breakpoints that define the aggregate periods for skims and assignment
    * ``labels`` - Labels to define names for aggregate periods for skims and assignment
* ``read_skim_cache`` - read cached skims (using numpy memmap) from output directory (memmap is faster than omx)
* ``write_skim_cache`` - write memmapped cached skims to output directory after reading from omx, for use in subsequent runs
* ``cache_dir`` - alternate dir to read/write skim cache (defaults to output_dir)

.. _sub-model-spec-files:

Sub-Model Specification Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Included in the ``configs`` folder are the model specification files that store the
Python/pandas/numpy expressions, alternatives, and other settings used by each model.  Some models includes an
alternatives file since the alternatives are not easily described as columns in the expressions file.  An example
of this is the ``non_mandatory_tour_frequency_alternatives.csv`` file, which lists each alternative as a row and each
columns indicates the number of non-mandatory tours by purpose.  The current set of files are below.

.. index:: chunk_size
.. _chunk_size:

Chunk size
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``chunk_size`` is the number of doubles in a chunk of a choosers table.  It is approximately the number
of rows times the number of columns.  If set greater than 0, then it is now dynamically calculated by processing a 
small sample of households to determine the necessary size for each submodel based on the size of the population, 
the complexity of the utility expressions, the amount of RAM on the machine, the number of processors, 
and other problem specific dimensions.

Logging
~~~~~~~

Included in the ``configs`` folder is the ``logging.yaml``, which configures Python logging
library and defines two key log files:

* ``activitysim.log`` - overall system log file
* ``hhtrace.log`` - household trace log file if tracing is on

Refer to the :ref:`tracing` section for more detail on tracing.

.. _model_steps :

Pipeline
~~~~~~~~

The ``models`` setting contains the specification of the data pipeline model steps, as shown below:

::

 models:
    - initialize_landuse
    - compute_accessibility
    - initialize_households
    - school_location
    - workplace_location
    - auto_ownership_simulate
    - free_parking
    - cdap_simulate
    - mandatory_tour_frequency
    - mandatory_tour_scheduling
    - joint_tour_frequency
    - joint_tour_composition
    - joint_tour_participation
    - joint_tour_destination
    - joint_tour_scheduling
    - non_mandatory_tour_frequency
    - non_mandatory_tour_destination
    - non_mandatory_tour_scheduling
    - tour_mode_choice_simulate
    - atwork_subtour_frequency
    - atwork_subtour_destination
    - atwork_subtour_scheduling
    - atwork_subtour_mode_choice
    - stop_frequency
    - trip_purpose
    - trip_destination
    - trip_purpose_and_destination
    - trip_scheduling
    - trip_mode_choice
    - write_data_dictionary
    - track_skim_usage
    - write_trip_matrices
    - write_tables

These model steps must be registered orca steps, as noted below.  If you provide a ``resume_after``
argument to :func:`activitysim.core.pipeline.run` the pipeliner will load checkpointed tables from the checkpoint store
and resume pipeline processing on the next model step after the specified checkpoint.

::

  resume_after = None
  #resume_after = 'school_location'

The model is run by calling the :func:`activitysim.core.pipeline.run` method.

::

  pipeline.run(models=_MODELS, resume_after=resume_after)

.. note::
   Users can skip persisting tables to the pipeline data store on disk by adding an underscore prefix to the models in the 
   models list in the settings file: _school_location instead of school_location.  This will cut down on the disk writes.

.. _example_run :

Running the MTC Example
-----------------------

To run the example, do the following:

* Activate the correct conda environment if needed
* View the list of available examples

::

  activitysim create --list

* Create a local copy of an example folder

::

  activitysim create --example example_mtc --destination my_test_example

* Run the example

::

  activitysim run --working_dir my_test_example

or

::

  activitysim run -c my_test_example/configs -d my_test_example/data -o my_test_example/output

* ActivitySim should log some information and write outputs to the output folder.

The example should complete within a couple minutes since it is running a small sample of households.

.. note::

  A customizable run script for power users can be found in the `Github repo <https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim/tree/master/scripts>`__.
  This script takes many of the same arguments as the ``activitysim run`` command, including paths to
  ``--config``, ``--data``, and ``--output`` directories. It looks for these folders in the current
  working directory by default.

  ::

    python simulation.py

Multiprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model system is parallelized via :ref:`multiprocessing`.  To setup and run the :ref:`example` using
multiprocessing, follow the same steps as the above :ref:`example_run`, but add an additional ``-c`` flag to
include the multiprocessing configuration settings as well:

::

  activitysim run -c my_test_example/configs_mp -c my_test_example/configs -d my_test_example/data -o my_test_example/output

The multiprocessing example also writes outputs to the output folder.

The default multiprocessed example is configured to run with two processors: ``num_processes: 2``.  Additional more performant configurations are
included and commented out in the example settings file.  For example, the 100 percent sample multiprocessing example was run on a Windows Server
machine with 28 cores @ 2.56GHz and 224GB RAM with the configuration below.  See :ref:`multiprocessing` for more information.

::

  households_sample_size:  0
  chunk_size:  1
  num_processes: 24

.. note::
   Anaconda Python on Windows uses the `Intel Math Kernel Library <https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl>`__ for
   many of its computationally intensive low-level C/C++ calculations.  By default, MKL threads many of its routines
   in order to be performant out-of-the-box.  However, for ActivitySim multiprocessing, which processes households in
   parallel since they are largely independent of one another, it can be advantageous to override threading within
   processes and instead let ActivitySim run each process with one computing core or thread.  In order to do so,
   override the MKL number of threads setting via a system environment variable that is set before running the model.
   In practice, this means before running the model, first set the MKL number of threads variable via the command
   line as follows: SET MKL_NUM_THREADS=1


Outputs
-------

The key output of ActivitySim is the HDF5 data pipeline file ``outputs\pipeline.h5``.  This file contains a copy
of each key data table after each model step in which the table was modified.  The example also writes the final tables to 
CSV files by using the :func:`activitysim.core.pipeline.get_table` method via the ``write_tables`` step.
This method returns a pandas DataFrame, which is then written to a CSV file by the ``write_tables`` step.

The ``other_resources\scripts\make_pipeline_output.py`` script uses the information stored in the pipeline file to create 
the table below for a small sample of households.  The table shows that for each table in the pipeline, the number of rows
and/or columns changes as a result of the relevant model step.  A ``checkpoints`` table is also stored in the
pipeline, which contains the crosswalk between model steps and table states in order to reload tables for
restarting the pipeline at any step.

The ``write_trip_matrices`` step processes the trips table to create open matrix (OMX) trip matrices for
assignment.  The matrices are configured and coded according to the expressions in the model step
trip annotation file.  See :ref:`write_trip_matrices` for more information.

ActivitySim also writes log and trace files to the ``outputs`` folder.  The activitysim.log file,
which is the overall log file is always produced.  If tracing is specified, then trace files are
output as well.

.. _tracing :

Tracing
~~~~~~~

There are two types of tracing in ActivtiySim: household and origin-destination (OD) pair.  If a household trace ID
is specified, then ActivitySim will output a comprehensive set (i.e. hundreds) of trace files for all
calculations for all household members:

* ``hhtrace.log`` - household trace log file, which specifies the CSV files traced. The order of output files is consistent with the model sequence.
* ``various CSV files`` - every input, intermediate, and output data table - chooser, expressions/utilities, probabilities, choices, etc. - for the trace household for every sub-model

If an OD pair trace is specified, then ActivitySim will output the acessibility calculations trace
file:

* ``accessibility.result.csv`` - accessibility expression results for the OD pair

With the set of output CSV files, the user can trace ActivitySim calculations in order to ensure they are correct and/or to
help debug data and/or logic errors.

.. _writing_logsums :

Writing Logsums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tour and trip destination and mode choice models calculate logsums but do not persist them by default.  
Mode and destination choice logsums are essential for re-estimating these models and can therefore be 
saved to the pipeline if desired.  To save the tour and trip destination and mode choice model logsums, include 
the following optional settings in the model settings file.  The data is saved to the pipeline for later use.

::

  # in workplace_location.yaml for example
  DEST_CHOICE_LOGSUM_COLUMN_NAME: workplace_location_logsum
  DEST_CHOICE_SAMPLE_TABLE_NAME: workplace_location_sample
  
  # in tour_mode_choice.yaml for example
  MODE_CHOICE_LOGSUM_COLUMN_NAME: mode_choice_logsum

The `DEST_CHOICE_SAMPLE_TABLE_NAME` contains the fields in the table below.  Writing out the 
destination choice sample table, which includes the mode choice logsum for each sampled 
alternative destination, adds significant size to the pipeline.  Therefore, this feature should
only be activated when writing logsums for a small set of households for model estimation.

.. _estimation :

Estimation
----------

.. note::
   Estimation mode is under development.  Estimation mode has not yet been implemented for the
   trip models (stop_frequency, trip_destination, trip_scheduling, and trip_mode_choice).  The trip 
   model expressions files are also in the old format - i.e. data and coefficients have yet to be 
   separated into different files.

ActivitySim includes the ability to easily re-estimate submodels using choice model estimation tools
such as `larch <https://larch.newman.me/>`__.  In order to do so, ActivitySim adopts the concept of an estimation 
data bundle (EDB), which is a collection of the necessary data to restimate a submodel.  For example, for the auto ownership submodel,
the EDB consists of the following files:

* model settings - the auto_ownership_model_settings.yaml file
* coefficients - the auto_ownership_coefficients.csv file with each coefficient name, value, and constrain set to True or False if the coefficient is estimatable
* utilities specification - the auto_ownership_SPEC.csv utility expressions file
* chooser and alternatives data - the auto_ownership_values_combined.csv file with all chooser and alternatives data such as household information, land use information, and the utility data components for each alternative

ActivitySim also includes :ref:`estimation_example` Jupyter notebooks for estimating models with larch.

The combination of writing an EDB for a submodel + a larch estimation notebook means users can easily re-estimate submodels. This 
combination of functionality means:

* There is no duplication of model specifications. ActivitySim owns the specification and larch pivots off of it.  Users code model specifications and utility expressions in ActivitySim so as to facilitate ease of use and eliminate inconsistencies and errors between the code used to estimate the models and the code used to apply the models.
* The EDB includes all the data and model structure information and the larch.util.activitysim module used by the example notebooks processes the EDB to setup and estimate the models.
* Users are able to add zones, alternatives, new chooser data, new taz data, new modes, new coefficients, revise utilities, and revise nesting structures in ActivitySim and larch responds accordingly.
* Eventually it may be desirable for ActivitySim to automatically write larch estimators (or other types of estimators), but for now the integration is loosely coupled rather than tightly coupled in order to provide flexibility. 

Workflow
~~~~~~~~

The general workflow for estimating models is shown in the figure below and explained in more detail below.

.. image:: images/estimation_example.jpg

* The user converts their household travel survey into ActivitySim format households, persons, tours, joint tour participants, and trip tables.  The households and persons tables must have the same fields as the synthetic population input tables since the surveyed households and persons will be run through the same set of submodels as the simulated households and persons.
* The ActivitySim estimation example ``scripts\infer.py`` module reads the ActivitySim format household travel survey files and checks for inconsistencies in the input tables versus the model design + calculates additional fields such as the household joint tour frequency based on the trips and joint tour participants table.  Survey households and persons observed choices much match the model design (i.e. a person cannot have more work tours than the model allows).
* ActivitySim is then run in estimation mode to read the ActivitySim format household travel survey files, run the ActivitySim submodels to write estimation data bundles (EDB) that contains the model utility specifications, coefficients, chooser data, and alternatives data for each submodel.  Estimation mode runs single-processed and without destination sampling.
* The relevant EDBs are read and transformed into the format required by the model estimation tool (i.e. larch) and then the coefficients are re-estimated.
* The user can then update the ActivitySim model coefficients file for the estimated submodel and re-run the model in simulation mode.  The user may want to use the restartable pipeline feature of ActivitySim to just run the submodel of interest.

.. _estimation_example:

Example
~~~~~~~

To run the estimation example, do the following:

* Activate the correct conda environment if needed
* Create a local copy of the estimation example folder

::

  activitysim create -e example_estimation -d test_example_estimation

* Run the example

::

  cd test_example_estimation
  activitysim run -c configs_estimation/configs -c configs -o output -d data_test


* ActivitySim should log some information and write outputs to the output folder, including EDBs for each submodel.  The estimation example runs in about 5 minutes and writes EDBs for 2000 households.

* Open the relevant estimation with larch example Jupyter Notebook and re-estimate the submodel:

  * `Estimating auto ownership <https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim/blob/master/activitysim/examples/example_estimation/notebooks/estimating_auto_ownership.ipynb/>`__
  * `Estimating school location <https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim/blob/master/activitysim/examples/example_estimation/notebooks/estimating_school_location.ipynb/>`__
  * `Estimating work location <https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim/blob/master/activitysim/examples/example_estimation/notebooks/estimating_workplace_location.ipynb/>`__
  * `Estimating tour mode choice <https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim/blob/master/activitysim/examples/example_estimation/notebooks/estimating_tour_mode_choice.ipynb/>`__

* Save the updated coefficient file to the configs folder and run the model in simulation mode.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

Additional settings for running ActivitySim in estimation mode are specified in the ``estimation.yaml`` file.  The settings are:

* ``enable`` - enable estimation, either True or False
* ``bundles`` - the list of submodels for which to write EDBs
* ``survey_tables`` - the list of input ActivitySim format survey tables with observed choices to override model simulation choices in order to write EDBs.  These tables are the output of the ``scripts\infer.py`` script that pre-processes the ActivitySim format household travel survey files

.. _multiple_zone_systems :

Multiple Zone Systems
---------------------

ActivitySim supports models with multiple zone systems.  The three versions of multiple zone systems are one-zone, two-zone, and three-zone. 

  * **One-zone**: This version is based on TM1 and supports only TAZs. All origins and destinations are represented at the TAZ level, and all skims including auto, transit, and non-motorized times and costs are also represented at the TAZ level.
  * **Two-zone**: This version is similar to many DaySim models. It uses microzones (MAZs) for origins and destinations, and TAZs for specification of auto and transit times and costs. Impedance for walk or bike "all the way" from the origin to the destination can be specified at the MAZ level for close together origins and destinations, and at the TAZ level for further origins and destinations. Users can also override transit walk access and egress times with times specified in the MAZ file by transit mode.  Careful pre-calculation of the assumed transit walk access and egress time by MAZ and transit mode is required depending on the network scenario.
  * **Three-zone**: This version is based on the SANDAG generation of CT-RAMP models. Origins and destinations are represented at the MAZ level. Impedance for walk or bike "all the way" from the origin to the destination can be specified at the MAZ level for close together origins and destinations, and at the TAZ level for further origins and destinations, just like the two-zone system. TAZs are used for auto times and costs. The difference between this system and the two-zone system is that transit times and costs are represented between Transit Access Points (TAPs), which are essentially dummy zones that represent transit stops or clusters of stops. Transit skims are built between TAPs, since there are typically too many MAZs to build skims between them. Often multiple sets of TAP to TAP skims (local bus only, all modes, etc.) are created and input to the demand model for consideration.  Walk access and egress times are also calculated between the MAZ and the TAP, and total transit path utilities are assembled from their respective components - from MAZ to first boarding TAP, from first boarding to final alighting TAP, and from alighting TAP to destination MAZ. This assembling is done via the :ref:`transit_virtual_path_builder` (TVPB), which considers all possible combinations of nearby boarding and alighting TAPs for each origin destination MAZ pair.

Regions that have an interest in more precise transit forecasts may wish to adopt the three-zone approach, while other regions may adopt the one or two-zone approach.  The microzone version requires coding households and land use at the microzone level.  Typically an all-streets network is used for representation of non-motorized impedances. This requires a routable all-streets network, with centroids and connectors for microzones.  If the three-zone system is adopted, procedures need to be developed to code TAPs from transit stops and populate the all-street network with TAP centroids and centroid connectors.  A model with transit virtual path building takes longer to run than a traditional
TAZ only model, but it provides a much richer framework for transit modeling.

Example configurations and inputs for two and three-zone system models are described below.

.. note::
   The two and three zone system test examples are dummy examples developed from the TM1 example.  To develop the two zone system
   example, TM1 TAZs were labeled MAZs, each MAZ was assigned a TAZ, and MAZ to MAZ impedance files were created from the
   TAZ to TAZ impedances.  To develop the three zone example system example, the TM1 TAZ model was further transformed 
   so select TAZs also became TAPs and TAP to TAP skims and MAZ to TAP impedances files were created.  While sufficient for 
   initial development, these examples were insufficient for validation and performance testing of the new software.
   
   To finalize development and verification of the multiple zone system and transit virtual path building components, the 
   `Transportation Authority of Marin County <https://www.tam.ca.gov/>`__ version of MTC's travel model two (TM2) work 
   tour mode choice model was implemented.  This example was also developed to test multiprocessed runtime performance.  
   The complete runnable setup is available from ActivitySim's command line interface as `example_3_marin_full`.  This example
   has essentially the same configuration as illustrated by the simpler examples below.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

To run the two zone and three zone system examples, do the following:

* Activate the correct conda environment if needed
* Create a local copy of the example

::

  # simple two zone example
  activitysim create -e example_2_zone -d test_example_2_zone
  
  # simple three zone example
  activitysim create -e example_3_zone -d test_example_3_zone
  
  # Marin TM2 work tour mode choice for the MTC region
  activitysim create -e example_3_marin_full -d test_example_3_marin_full
  

* Change to the example directory
* Run the example

::

  # simple two zone example
  activitysim run -c configs_local -c configs_2_zone -c configs -d data_2 -o output_2
  
  # simple three zone example, single process and multiprocess
  activitysim run -c configs_local -c configs_3_zone -c configs -d data_3 -o output_3 -s settings_static.yaml
  activitysim run -c configs_local -c configs_3_zone -c configs -d data_3 -o output_3 -s settings_mp.yaml
  
  # Marin TM2 work tour mode choice for the MTC region
  activitysim run -c configs_3_zone_marin_full -c configs_3_zone_marin -d data_3_marin_full -o output_3_marin_full -s settings_mp.yaml


Settings
~~~~~~~~

Additional settings for running ActivitySim with two or three zone systems are specified in the ``network_los.yaml`` file.  The settings are:

**Two Zone**

The additional two zone system settings and inputs are described and illustrated below.  No additional utility expression files or expression revisions are required beyond the one zone approach.  The MAZ data is available as zone data and the MAZ to MAZ data is available using the existing skim expressions.  Users can specify mode utilities using MAZ data, MAZ to MAZ impedances, and TAZ to TAZ impedances.

* ``zone_system`` - set to 2 for two zone system
* ``maz`` -  MAZ data file, with MAZ ID, TAZ, and land use and other MAZ attributes
* ``maz_to_maz:tables`` - list of MAZ to MAZ impedance tables.  These tables are read as pandas DataFrames and the columns are exposed to expressions.
* ``maz_to_maz:max_blend_distance`` - in order to avoid cliff effects, the lookup of MAZ to MAZ impedance can be a blend of origin MAZ to destination MAZ impedance and origin TAZ to destination TAZ impedance up to a max distance.  The calculated value is the (MAZ to MAZ distance) * (distance / max distance) * (TAZ to TAZ distance) * (1 - (distance / max distance)).  This requires specifying a distance TAZ skim and distance columns from the MAZ to MAZ files.  The TAZ skim name and MAZ to MAZ column name need to be the same so the blending can happen on-the-fly.
* ``maz_to_maz:blend_distance_skim_name`` - Identify the distance skim for the blending calculation if different than the blend skim.

      DISTBIKE: 0
      DISTWALK: 1
  
    blend_distance_skim_name: DIST


**Three Zone**

In addition to the extra two zone system settings and inputs above, the following additional settings and inputs are required for a three zone system model.  Examples values are illustrated below.

In ``settings.yaml``

* ``models`` - add initialize_los and initialize_tvpb to load network LOS inputs / skims and pre-compute TAP to TAP utilities for TVPB.  See :ref:`initialize_los`.

:: 

  models:
    - initialize_landuse
    - compute_accessibility
    - initialize_households
    # ---
    - initialize_los
    - initialize_tvpb
    # ---
    - school_location
    - workplace_location

In ``network_los.yaml``

* ``zone_system`` - set to 3 for three zone system
* ``rebuild_tvpb_cache`` - rebuild and overwrite existing pre-computed TAP to TAP utilities cache
* ``trace_tvpb_cache_as_csv`` - write a CSV version of TVPB cache for tracing 
* ``tap_skims`` - TAP to TAP skims OMX file name. The time period for the matrix must be represented at the end of the matrix name and be seperated by a double_underscore (e.g. BUS_IVT__AM indicates base skim BUS_IVT with a time period of AM.
* ``tap`` - TAPs table
* ``tap_lines`` - table of transit line names served for each TAP.  This file is used to trimmed the set of nearby TAP for each MAZ so only TAPs that are further away and serve new service are included in the TAP set for consideration.  It is a very important file to include as it can considerably reduce runtimes.  
* ``maz_to_tap`` - list of MAZ to TAP access/egress impedance files by user defined mode.  Examples include "walk" and "drive".  The file also includes MAZ to TAP impedances.
* ``maz_to_tap:{walk}:max_dist`` - max distance from MAZ to TAP to consider TAP
* ``maz_to_tap:{walk}:tap_line_distance_col`` - MAZ to TAP data field to use for TAP lines distance filter
* ``demographic_segments`` - list of user defined demographic_segments for pre-computed TVPB impedances.  Each chooser is coded with a user defined demographic segment.
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:units`` - specify the units for calculations, e.g. utility or time.
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:path_types`` - user defined set of TVPB path types to be calculated and available to the mode choice models.  Examples include walk transit walk ("WTW"), drive transit walk ("DTW"), and walk transit drive ("WTD").
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:path_types:{WTW}:access`` - access mode for the path type
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:path_types:{WTW}:egress`` - egress mode for the path type
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:path_types:{WTW}:max_paths_across_tap_sets`` - max paths to keep across all skim sets, for example, 3 TAP to TAP pairs per origin MAZ destination MAZ pair
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:path_types:{WTW}:max_paths_per_tap_set`` - max paths to keep per skim set, for example 1 per skim set - all transit submodes, local bus only, etc.

Unlike the one and two zone system approach, the three zone system approach requires additional expression files for the TVPB.  The additional expression files for the TVPB are:

* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:tap_tap_settings:SPEC`` - TAP to TAP expressions, e.g. tvpb_utility_tap_tap.csv
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:tap_tap_settings:PREPROCESSOR:SPEC`` - TAP to TAP chooser preprocessor, e.g. tvpb_utility_tap_tap_annotate_choosers_preprocessor.csv
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:maz_tap_settings:walk:SPEC`` - MAZ to TAP {walk} expressions, e.g. tvpb_utility_walk_maz_tap.csv
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:maz_tap_settings:drive:SPEC`` - MAZ to TAP {drive} expressions, e.g. tvpb_utility_drive_maz_tap.csv
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:accessibility:tap_tap_settings:SPEC`` - TAP to TAP expressions for the accessibility calculator, e.g. tvpb_accessibility_tap_tap.csv
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:accessibility:maz_tap_settings:walk:SPEC`` - MAz to TAP {walk} expressions for the accessibility calculator, e.g. tvpb_accessibility_walk_maz_tap.csv

Additional settings to configure the TVPB are:

* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:tap_tap_settings:attribute_segments:demographic_segment`` - TVPB pre-computes TAP to TAP total utilities for demographic segments.  These are defined using the attribute_segments keyword.  In the example below, the segments are demographic_segment (household income bin), tod (time-of-day), and access_mode (drive, walk).
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:maz_tap_settings:{walk}:CHOOSER_COLUMNS`` - input impedance columns to expose for TVPB calculations.
* ``TVPB_SETTINGS:maz_tap_settings:{walk}:CONSTANTS`` - constants for TVPB calculations.
* ``accessibility:...`` - for the accessibility model step, the same basic set of TVPB configurations are available.
