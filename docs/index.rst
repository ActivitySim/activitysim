ActivitySim
===========

ActivitySim is an open platform for activity-based travel modeling. It emerged
from a consortium of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and other
transportation planning agencies that wanted to build a shared, open, platform
that could be easily adapted to their individual needs, but would share a
robust, efficient, and well-maintained common core.

ActivitySim is being built on the same methodology and software stack that
UrbanSim_ is based on, and will initially have dependencies on UrbanSim, but
these may eventually be eliminated by refactoring UrbanSim and creating a
common core that both UrbanSim and ActivitySim depend on.
